Client's Latency Calculation Too High (Jan 21, 2009)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
When both server and client applications are hosted on one machine, the client's ping time is always 0.5-1 ms or so higher than server (which is usually 0.1-0.2 ms).
This is because of the "Update the last latency for all players" code takes about 0.5-1 ms to execute... "for (u_int nPlayer = 0; nPlayer < nPlayerCount; ++nPlayer) {}"
