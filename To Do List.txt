eX0 To Do List
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
-Keep clocks in sync by periodically sending time-correcting ping packets.
-Have the server know its ping time to the clients too, and broadcast it to all clients.
-Design a better time->state determinant system.
-Make spawning/joining a new team a timed event in the future, in case old UDP command packets arrive late.
-Add a time out for non-ACCEPTED connected sockets, ie. to get rid of connected non-clients.
