Newest Changes [Jan 15, 2009]

-Naturally, bFirstCommand is phased out as well.
-Also considering phasing out cLastRecvedCommandSequenceNumber. Do it for now. Actually, it might be a good idea to keep it, because otherwise it's hard to figure out if cmd with SN -1 is slighly old, or new but after 3+ sec of lag...
-Phased out cLastAckedCommandSequenceNumber... Rethinking.
-GameSession->GlobalStateSequenceNumberTEST replaces g_cCurrentCommandSequenceNumber.
-Currently it takes State #0 and Command #1 to produce State #1. TODO: Change to St#0+Cmd#0=St#1
-CPlayer::oLatestAuthStateTEST is replacing CPlayer::fX,fY,fZ and cLatestAuthStateSequenceNumber

game logic loop
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
-time.++g_cCurrentCommandSequenceNumber (every 50 ms only)
-players.tick[PlayerController] (every 50 ms only): request input
-players.AfterTick[PlayerStateAuther]: process input, convert to auth-seek, locally predicted state, etc.
-players.ProcessUpdate[PlayerStateAuther]: process received auth-update
-players.SendUpdate[PlayerStateAuther] (every 60 ms only): send a complete network update to each of the players
